# RDataFrame
Welcome to the additional exercises of the **RDataFrame** learning module! What you can find 
here is an example of a HEP analysis that uses the `RDataFrame` tool. Open the notebook
and follow the instructions to fill it in. In the `solutions` folder you can find 
the solutions in a notebook format, as well as python macro and a fully compiled 
C++ code - so you can see and compare what the the same analysis code looks like 
in C++, can you execute `rdataframe-dimuon.cpp` as well?
